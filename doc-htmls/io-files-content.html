    <h1 id="input"> Input Files</h1>
    <div class="break"></div> <!----------------------------------- File 1: main.in ------------------------------------>
    <h2 id="main"> File 1: main.in</h2>
    The main.in will be the file given to swift as stdin(Standard input). It contains file names to the other input files. It also contains threshold_mass.
    <br><br>

    <div class="name">main.in</div>
    <div class="file">
name_param.in
name_pl.in
threshold_mass         
    </div>
    Anything more massive than threshold_mass is embryo, anything less massive is a planetesimal. Mass should be consistent with the units you’ve decided on (usually 1 time=1 year ,1 distance=1 AU, 1 mass=5.06e28 kg meaning 1 solar mass=39.52 mass).

    <div class="break"></div> <!----------------------------------- File 2: param.in ------------------------------------>

    <h2 id="param"> File 2: param.in</h2>
    This file contains all the parameters needed for SyMBA to run. It dictates events such as stop time, data dumps, threshold distances for tracking bodies etc.

        LINE 1
                t0 : the initial time
                tstop :the time to stop the integration
                dt : the timestep
             *the unit of time is consistent with units selected (simulation time)

               Compwall : wall time for the code
             *recommended that stout=dtdump for easy simulation resumption
             *For a 48hr walltime (in the .sh file), give the code a maximum wall
        time of 30 hr to give you a good buffer time

                L1-L6 are logicals and are set to T or F
                  L1:  .true.==> Include J2 and J4 for central body.  These values
                                 must be included in the pl.in file.
                  L2:  .true.==> Does the various checks for coming too close to Sun
                                 or planet, or too far from Sun.  If particles are
                                 removed a file called 'discard.out' will contain a
                                 set of entries for each removed particle that gives
                                 the time, the particle's posn and vel and istat flags
                                 and rstat flags (see a file called README.stat for a
                                 discription of the status flags), as well as all the
                                 planetary posns and vels. at the time of removal.
                                 So you will have a complete discription of the
                                 planetary system at removal time if you need it.
                         NOTE: IF THIS BIT IS NOT SET YOU SHOULD OMIT THE LINE
                         IN PARAM.IN THAT CONTAINS RMIN, RMAX ETC. AND HAVE ONLY
                         THREE LINES IN ALL :  THE LAST HAVING THE NAME OF
                         THE BINARY OUTPUT FILE.
                  L3:  .true.==>  Computes Jacobi integral for the tps (only useful
                                  if have only one planet on circ. orbit).  Writes to
                                  a file called jacobi.out
                  L4:  .true.==> Computes energy and ang. momentum and writes out
                                 to a file called energy.out. (of course this only
                                 checks the accuracy of the planetary integrations).
                  L5:  .true.==> Write to a binary output file the heliocentric
                                 orbital elements of all bodies and test particles.
                                 The elements are written as REAL*4. The elements are
                                 a,e,i,OMEGA,omega and M, where OMEGA is the long. of
                                 ascending node, omega is arg. of peri. and M is mean
                                 anomaly. ROUTINES TO READ FROM THE BINARY FILE ARE
                                 GIVEN IN FOR EXAMPLE THE ROUTINE "FOLLOW" IN THE
                                 "TOOLS" DIRECTORY. TO USE FOLLOW SIMPLY RESPOND TO
                                 THE PROMPTS (e.g. the last query is for which
                                 particle # to follow - use a positive integer for a
                                 tp or a negative number if you want to follow a
                                 planet (e.g. -3 for the third massive body ie the
                                 second planet).
                  L6:  .true.==> Same as L5 except that Swift write an XDR file.
                         NOTE: L5 and L6 cannot both be set to .true.
        
                rmin is the heliocentric distance at which a tp is stopped because
                     it is deemed to be too close to the central body.
                     SET TO -1. if you want to ignore this check
                rmax is the heliocentric distance at which a tp is stopped because
                     it is deemed to be too far from the central body
                     SET TO -1. if you want to ignore this check
                rmaxu is the heliocentric distance at which a tp is stopped because
                     it is deemed to be too far from the central body AND it
                     is also unbound with respect to the central body
                     SET TO -1. if you want to ignore this check
                qmin is the perihelion distance at which a tp is stopped because
                     it is deemed to be too close to the central body.
                     SET TO -1. if you want to ignore this check
                 Note:  The orbital elements computed are the osculating
                            (instantaneous) HELIOCENTRIC values. Because of the
                            motion of the Sun induced by the planets, these values
                            are unrepresentative of the barycentric values for
                            particles which have semi-major axes beyond a few
                            hundred AU.  In particular, values for the pericentric
                            distance and the inclination will vary considerably. As
                            a result we STRONGLY RECOMMEND that a value of RMAX of
                            a few hundred AU be used if a nonzero value of QMIN is
                            used.
                lclose is a logical.  If .true. then the code will check for close
                     approaches between tp and planets.  If tp gets within a distance
                     rpl (physical radius of planet) of the planet then it is stopped.  rpl for each planet must
                     be included in the pl.in if this flag is set.  NOTE: we recommend
                     that rpl be greater than a Hill sphere if you are using WHM.
                binary_outputfile is the name of a binary file to store the
                    orbital elements at time intervals dtout (see below).
                status_flag_for_open_statements is the status flag for the open
                statements of all the output files but lyap.dat.  Must be one
                of the following:
                                 new      (program dies if the file exists)
                                 append   (data is appended to the file)
                                 unknown  (data is written over existing data).
        
        NOTES : 1) Every dtout time increments, the code outputs various quantities,
                 depending on the value of the logical flags L1-L6 (read in from
                 param.in).
        
                2) At time increments set by dtdump, the code dumps all of
                the information needed to resume the integration at that time
                in case of power failures or in case one wishes to resume an
                integration from its endpoint. The info. is in 3 files called
                dump_pl.dat,  dump_tp.dat, and dump_param.dat.  The format is
                identical to pl.in, tp.in and param.in respectively.  Note
                that t0 in dump_param.dat records the time of the dump and
                that the status_flag_for_open_statements is changed to
                `append', so that these files can be used to restart a stopped
                integration.  Depending on the situation, one may wish to
                increase tstop in order to extend an integration.   The files
                are overwritten with each dump so only the most recent one is
                preserved.
        
                NOTE: We strongly suggest that you set dtdump=dtout.  This will
                      make it easier to restart the program if your computer
                      goes down.

From original README.first:

In addition:  if L1 = .true. then next to the Sun must be the values of J_2 * R^2 and J_4 R^4, here R is the radius of the central body.  

If L2=.true. and lclose=.true. than the lines that contain the masses of the planets must also include the stopping radius.
